there are two types of pains in life the pain of discipline and the pain of regret now pain is unavoidable in your human experience but one pain right the pain of discipline weighs ounces while the pain of regret weighs pounds what does this mean this means that in life pain is unavoidable it is undeniable right this idea that you can live life without consequences that you can instill bad habits in your life and that is inconsequential to the outcome of your future is a fallacy the matrix wants you to believe that yolo you only live once the question is how do you live that one time do you live it with regret or do you live it by instilling discipline and having the ability to control the source of the pain and then the outcome of what that pain wields now a lot of you guys want to avoid pain because you don't understand that pain is elemental to your human experience the pressure of life will crush you now the question is will it wield a diamond or not and all of that has to do from the source by which that pain comes from now if you instill discipline it is painful right not having to hang out with certain people having to establish a routine having to establish healthy lifestyles having to establish healthy eating habits having to cut out the bullshit in your life saying hey no i'm not going out tonight because i got things that i need to accomplish in order to live a life that is not full of regret now on the other side you have the pain of regret this regret usually comes from a lifestyle that is massively hedonistic a lifestyle that is massively promiscuous that has no limitations no boundaries and instills zero discipline most people live this lifestyle because they think that they're never going to have to pay the piper that they're never going to have to pay the bill for the decisions of their life for the actions of their life now we understand by newton's law that every action has an equal and opposite reaction that for everything that you input into the universe you will receive an equal proportion in output so the question is what are you inputting and what type of pain is going to come from that are you going to regret it or are you going to instill discipline in such a way that you can control the outcome of your life and your decisions as i'm here in phuket thailand we have a couple villas and mansions here and kind of reminiscing my life over the past couple years i came to realize that by instilling discipline and suffering in that short term period those two hours three hours of just gruesome intention every single day have allowed me to live a life that i have no regrets and it's not regrets because i'm an arrogant person i'm like i don't regret anything that i've done right it's not that it's that the life that i have is a life that has no regrets because there's nothing to regret because everything that i've done has been intentional everything's been done with discipline and dedication and you can do the same so the question is how do you want to live your life now if i take you to an old retirement home if i take you to a hospital you will witness it's very palpable you can feel it in the air it's very dense the pain of regret is real and unless you instill discipline in your life unless you instill habits unless you instill circles of influence friends and put yourself in a situation where there's discipline that allows you to live a life of fullness over the long period that gives you the ability to have a lifespan longevity full of health wealth love and happiness you need to understand that you must be willing to suffer today to become something tomorrow instead of having anything you want today and having to pay the bill tomorrow and i promise you that bill is very fucking expensive it comes with interest and it's very fat so as you watch this video ask yourself what type of life do i want do i want to instill these habits that are going to push me to the next level or am i just going to continue doing what i've always done i'm just going to continue doing what every other fucker is out here doing you're going to have the same results you're going to have the same outcome now the question is what do i want now you're on the other side of the screen most likely on your phone and honestly the decisions of your life have no impact and have no consequence to who i am as an individual so me saying this to you is actually because i care i truly care and i want you to understand these principles because had somebody come into my life and told me these things a lot earlier i would have been in a situation where i would have had to make decisions in a different way and now i'm in a situation where i had to learn through experience and i'm giving you the opportunity to not learn through experience but to learn through the experience of others just like tony robbins said the pain of discipline it only weighs a few ounces but the pain that comes from regret weighs tons it's a burden because you can't do anything about it but you can control the discipline that you instill in your life one of the examples are these super athletes whether it's cristiano ronaldo whether it's lebron james they spend millions of dollars on their body every single year the discipline that comes right and in their life yields fruitful results in many aspects so ask yourself what's the life i want what's the life that i want to live and what am i willing to sacrifice and become disciplined in so i don't have to deal with the regret and the bullshit of the future it's your life you only get one ask yourself am i willing to have the pain of discipline or will i deal with the pain of regret
