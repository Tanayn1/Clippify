regret this regret usually comes from a lifestyle that is massively hedonistic a
lifestyle that is massively promiscuous
that has no limitations no boundaries
and instills zero discipline most people
live this lifestyle because they think
that they're never going to have to pay
the piper that they're never going to
have to pay the bill for the decisions
of their life for the actions of their
life now we understand by Newton's law
that every action has an equal and
opposite reaction that for everything
that you input into the universe you
will receive an equal proportion and
output so the question is what are you
inputting and what type of pain is going
to come come from that are you going to
regret it or you going to still
